written following TDD style using mocha/chai tests

following a tutorial found here: [https://github.com/mmerkes/sudoku_solvers](https://github.com/mmerkes/sudoku_solvers)


**TODO**

* write a sudoku template generator and import them into the solver
* create an interface for this (ionic?)
* could be used to make a sudoku game and be able to check for hints and correct solution by user
* improve big O speed of solver
